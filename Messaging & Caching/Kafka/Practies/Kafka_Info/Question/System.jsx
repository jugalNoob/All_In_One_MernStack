ðŸ”¹ Scenario & System Design Questions

Design a Kafka architecture for:

3 producers sending user events

Topic with 3 partitions

Consumer group with 5 consumers
ðŸ‘‰ Explain how load balancing and partition assignment works.

You have 100k events/sec and want exactly-once processing with retries. How would you design this?

How do you design Kafka + MongoDB pipeline for real-time analytics?

If one consumer in a group is slow, what happens? How do you handle it?

If a producer sends messages without a key to a topic with 5 partitions, how does Kafka decide partition placement?

How do you ensure order of messages for a given user ID in Kafka?

What happens when a Kafka broker goes down? What happens to the leader partitions?

How do you implement delayed message processing in Kafka (since Kafka doesnâ€™t support delay natively)?

How do you scale Kafka consumers when partitions are limited?

If Kafka cluster has 3 brokers and replication factor is 3, what happens if 2 brokers go down?
