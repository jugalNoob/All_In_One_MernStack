🔄 7. Data Sync & Replication
📌 Projects:
Offline-First App with Sync Protocol (IndexedDB + MongoDB Sync)

Two-Way Replication Protocol between two MongoDB clusters

Real-Time GPS Tracker App with consistent state sync

Purpose: Simulate distributed systems or mobile sync protocols.





Could you please clarify what you mean by “MongoDB Sync”?

Here are some possible interpretations — let me know which one you're referring to, or if it's something else:

1. ✅ Syncing Between Two MongoDB Databases
You want to replicate/sync data between:

Two MongoDB instances (e.g., dev → prod)

Local MongoDB → cloud MongoDB

➡️ Solutions:

Use mongodump + mongorestore (manual sync)

Use MongoDB Atlas Data Federation / Live Migrations

Write a Node.js or Python sync script

2. 📡 Syncing MongoDB With Frontend in Real-Time
You want real-time data sync between MongoDB and frontend (e.g., React, Angular, etc.)

➡️ Solutions:

Use Change Streams (MongoDB 3.6+)

Use WebSockets or Socket.IO

Use Kafka or BullMQ to emit events

3. 🔁 Two-Way Sync with Offline Devices
You want to sync MongoDB data between:

Central server & mobile/IoT/edge device

MongoDB & local file/database

➡️ Solutions:

Use Realm Sync (MongoDB Realm) (for mobile)

Build custom sync logic with lastModified timestamps and conflict resolution

4. 📥 Scheduled Synchronization
Sync data every 5 minutes/hour between databases or APIs and MongoDB

➡️ Solutions:

Use node-cron or Agenda.js

Use Kafka consumers or cron-based queues

5. ⚙️ Replica Sets / Clustering
You’re talking about MongoDB internal sync between nodes:

Primary → Secondary nodes (replica set)

Sharded clusters

➡️ Solutions:

Set up a replica set or MongoDB sharding

Configure mongod instances with appropriate roles
