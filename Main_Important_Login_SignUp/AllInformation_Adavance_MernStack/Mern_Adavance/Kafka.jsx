Real-time stream processing

Decoupling microservices

Event-driven architecture

🧱 Core Concepts


| Component          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**       | Sends data (events/messages) to Kafka topics                     |
| **Consumer**       | Subscribes to and reads messages from topics                     |
| **Broker**         | Kafka server that stores and serves messages                     |
| **Topic**          | Named stream to which producers publish and consumers subscribe  |
| **Partition**      | A topic is split into partitions for scalability and parallelism |
| **Offset**         | Unique ID for each message in a partition                        |
| **Consumer Group** | Group of consumers for load-balanced message consumption         |
| **ZooKeeper**      | Manages metadata (Now optional in newer Kafka versions >= 2.8)   |
